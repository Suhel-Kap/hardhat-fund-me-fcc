# Sample Hardhat Project

The contract can be viewed here [on Rinkeby Etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/tx/0xdd9dc8afe4025eca5a3122e129b8e97fdd3a77b2fc42b0e40b2865c339195f5b).

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
